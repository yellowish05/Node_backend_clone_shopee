    title: 'Cancellations on orders Policy',
    text: `Last Update: August 1, 2019

    On Shoclef.com, like in life, things don’t always go as planned, and you’re forced to make a decision you may not have otherwise made. Whether you’re a buyer or seller, there are instances when canceling an order is the only option. Today we’re going to show you a better way.
    But before we tackle ways to prevent order cancellations, let’s look at some frequently asked questions from our community on the types of order cancellations, and how they affect your seller account:
    What Are The Different Types Of Order Cancellations ?
        Shoclef.com Customer Support has detailed information about Shoclef.com’s cancellations policy. Here are some relevant details for sellers to be aware of:
    – Buyer Requested Cancellations: Buyers can request a cancellation as long as the order isn’t in “status completed”. If the seller doesn’t respond within 48 hours the order will be cancelled. Another option is if an order is late, then a buyer can cancel without the need of the seller’s approval. Cancellations when an order is late can have a negative impact on a seller’s business. This also leaves sellers in a pointF in which they may have worked already, for no pay. For those reasons, this kind of cancellation should be avoided by sending your Order on time.
    – Mutual Cancellations: This is one way to resolve an order that both parties can’t agree on. If one side requests and the other accepts within 24 hours, then the order is cancelled mutually. If a buyer doesn’t respond within two days of a seller initiating a Mutual Cancellation, the Order is automatically canceled and the cancellation is listed as seller initiated.
    – Customer Support: If sellers and buyers don’t agree to a mutual cancellation, then contacting Shoclef.com Customer Support is the next step.
    How Does Cancellations Affect My Ranking ?
        We cannot reveal the exact calculation, however, Shoclef.com doesn’t just look at the amount of cancellations occurred. There are different indicators involved in evaluating cancellations of orders. We look at when the cancellation occurred, if the cancellation could have been avoided, and who the buyer is.
    Cancellations are just one parameter taken into account when evaluating a seller, however, it’s an important one. You, as a seller, should provide high quality service, communicate quickly when needed, provide the deliveries on time, and of course, try to minimize cancellations. With the new analytics page you’ll have a better overview of your performance, and thus, a better opportunity to improve it!
    Now that we’ve covered the basics, take a look below at the situations and the corresponding steps you can take as a seller, to help prevent cancellations. Essentially, these are your seller lifelines and guidelines. We suggest you use them often.
    The Buyer Has Yet To Submit Order Requirements.
    The seller should use the “NUDGE” option within the order page. This notifies the buyer that the seller is waiting for requirements.
If the seller didn’t receive a response from the buyer, and the order is still pending, the seller can use the Resolution Center to open a dispute to cancel the order.
    The Buyer Ordered By Mistake Or Ordered Twice.
    In this case, it’s the buyer responsibility to cancel the order. However, if the buyer does not cancel the order, we recommend using the Resolution Center to initiate cancellation.
        FAQ: A buyer was abusive and kept demanding and ordering things I don’t provide and my only option was to cancel, will this cancellation affect me ?
            Order understands that some orders may result in cancellations because the buyer is difficult to work with. Therefore, Order “flags” those buyers with a history of poor collaboration, and these cancellation won’t count against you.
    The Buyer Has Not Submitted The Full Requirements.
    The seller should ask the buyer for clarifications. We strongly recommend to do so once the requirements are sent and not wait until the last minute where the only option is to cancel. The seller should evaluate the Order requirements and make sure they’re clear and cover all the information, which is required to start the order.
    The Buyer Requested Work, Which Is Beyond The Scope Of This Order Or Costs More Than What Was Actually Paid.
    – The seller should clearly explain the difference between the price the buyer paid and what the seller is offering.
    – The seller can modify the order in the Resolution Center and add relevant extras to reflect the scope of the work requested.
    – If this cannot be done within the current order, the seller should send the buyer the relevant Order or a custom offer and initiate cancellation.
    – The seller should also review the Order title, description, pricing, requirements and gallery and make sure they accurately represent the scope of the work the seller provides. The seller should update the FAQs to answer most common questions buyers may have.
    The Buyer Requested Work, Which The Seller Is Not Qualified To Do Or Not Offered In This Order.
    – In this case, when a seller receives an order they can’t do and the only option is to cancel it, the seller needs to initiate a dispute quickly. In addition, the seller should let the buyer know that they can’t perform this job. Order understands that in some case a seller receives orders, which aren’t offered, but it’s the seller’s responsibility to communicate quickly that they can’t or won’t do it.
        FAQ: Many times I receive orders from buyers who don’t understand my service and ask for things I don’t offer. Therefore, I need to cancel the order, so why do you count all cancellations ?
            Order monitors all aspects of an order and why it was cancelled. We take this into consideration when evaluating cancellations. As a seller, you should do your best to avoid cancellations and make sure the percentage of cancellations from your total orders is low. Order is aware that there are cases when cancellations are the only option.
    The Buyer Is Not Responding And I Need Their Feedback To Progress With The Order.
    – The seller should write the buyer again. If no response is received within two to three days before the set delivery date, you should use the Resolution Center and request to extend the delivery time. If the buyer is still unresponsive, the seller may use the Resolution Center to cancel the order.
    The Buyer Wasn’t Satisfied With The Final Delivery.
    – If this Order includes revisions, the seller should try to work things out with the buyer and understand what updates are required to improve this delivery.
    – The seller can send a custom offer to the buyer for the cost of a revision.
    – The seller must review the Order gallery, offered package, pricing, and Order description and make sure they represent the quality of work the seller provides.
    So there you have it. Some key tips to avoiding cancellations, and probably a few nuggets of truth to take away. The best part about Order is the community of amazing people, so as long as you stick to these guidelines, and continue to be awesome, you should have no problem. And if you’re looking for additional help, one of our sellers created a two - part piece for the academy on tricks he’s learned after years on Order to minimize cancellations as well as poor reviews. You can find part one here, and part two here.

    title: 'Cancellations Policy',
    text: `Last Updated: August 1 2019

    Shoclef Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries in different countries encourages sellers and buyers to mutually resolve disputes within an order and avoid cancellations.
    As a seller, you should do your best to come to a mutual agreement, where both sides are happy with the end result. Cancelling orders negatively affects the buyer experience, and can cause a loss of time and money for the seller.
        Unfortunately, sometimes things just don’t work out, and cancellation is the only way to resolve an order. This solution, however, should be considered a last resort. Therefore, when resolving the issue, please communicate clearly and be polite throughout the cancellation process.
    Resolution Center
    You should make the most of the options offered in the Resolution Center. When there is no other way to save the order, you can use the cancellation option.
        Evaluation
    All cancellations are taken into account when evaluating a seller. Shoclef is aware that some cancellations are inevitable, therefore, those types of cancellations will have a lower impact on your performance scores, which affect your ranking.
    Order Completion
    One of the ways to evaluate a seller’s performance is through their “Order Completion” rate. The Order Completion rate consists of the number of cancellations subtracted from 100 % of the seller’s total of orders, over the last 60 days.
    The Offered Service
    To minimize cancellations, make sure you only provide Orders, which match your skill set. Don’t offer things you cannot do or are not qualified to do. 
Gig Page
    As a seller, you should accurately display your latest work and set reasonable delivery times. This is crucial in helping you to provide high quality deliveries to your buyers. Be very clear about the pricing and scope of the Service you provide. We recommend that you communicate in a quick and efficient manner with your buyer and make sure you’re aligned on the service being delivered.
        Communication
    When receiving an order, make sure you have all necessary information to start working. If something is not clear, we recommend immediately contacting your buyer for clarification. If cancellation is inevitable, we recommended not waiting until the last minute.
        Delivery
    You should do your best to deliver on time. Plan your work accordingly and make sure your delivery time is realistic. When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. There are cases where sellers will deliver incomplete work to avoid being late, and this behavior is unacceptable. Sending a delivery to avoid being late is a violation of Shoclef’s Terms of Service and could result in your account being reviewed. Shoclef’s encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it’s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.
        Availability
    In cases where you may have personal issues, technical difficulties, or are simply overbooked, we recommend setting your status to Vacation Mode, even if it’s just for a short time. In addition, you can avoid the need to cancel orders, which is a poor experience for our buyers. If you find that you are doing this often, consider limiting your orders in queue to avoid being overbooked.

    Encouraging or urging people to embrace self - injury is counter to this environment of support, and we’ll remove it or disable accounts if it’s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self - injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.

Each of us is an important part of the Shoclef community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by reporting these violations. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly.

    At Shoclef, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. . This cookie policy applies to any Shoclef product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference

    Does Shoclef use cookies ?

        Yes. As described in Privacy Policy, we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses Shoclef.com has the best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.

    What is a cookie ?

        A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Shoclef.com features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Shoclef and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Shoclef and help us serve relevant ads to you.

    When does Shoclef place cookies ?

        We use cookies on our sites(such as Shoclef.com and slideshare. net) and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non - Shoclef sites that host our plugins(for example, Shoclef 's \"Share\" button) or tags.

What types of cookies does Shoclef use ?

        We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Shoclef or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Shoclef when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services (for example, our sharing or job application buttons). Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

    Which Shoclef entity is using cookies ?

        If you reside in the United States, Shoclef Inc. will be responsible for your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services. If you reside outside the United States, Shoclef will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services.

What are cookies used for?

        Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Shoclef.com, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that's in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Shoclef faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Shoclef sites, and bring customized features to you through Shoclef plugins such as our \"Share\" button.

    Categories of Use

    Authentication
    If you're signed in to Shoclef.com, cookies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience

    Security

    We use cookies to enable and support our security features, and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.

        Preferences, features and services

    Cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. They can help you fill out forms on Shoclef more easily. They also provide you with features, insights, and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. You can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy.

        Advertising

    We may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on and off the Shoclef site. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action(e. g. downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on the advertiser's site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we've shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off Shoclef, such as after you've visited a partner's site or application.

        Performance, Analytics and Research

    Cookies help us learn how well our site and plugins perform in different locations. We also use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access Shoclef from other websites, applications, or devices such as your work computer or your mobile device.

    What is Do Not Track(DNT) ?

        DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U. S. Federal Trade Commission(FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium(W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Shoclef does not generally respond to \"do not track\" signals.

    How are cookies used for advertising purposes ?

        Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by Shoclef may also set third party cookies.
    If you are logged in on Shoclef.com, the Shoclef app or another Service that references this Cookie Policy or browsing a third party partner site of Shoclef and one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage(such as your browsing behavior) and log data(such as your IP address), will be associated by us with your account as noted in Section 1.3.  of our Privacy Policy. We also use aggregate data from third parties and data from your profile and Shoclef activity.
    If you are a Shoclef member but logged out of your account on a browser, Shoclef may still continue to log your interaction with our services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our services, which analytics we may share in aggregate form with our advertising customers.
    Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:
    provide more relevant, interest - based advertising
    provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads
    help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
    detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners
    improve our products
    We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers unless you have given us permission to do so. You can opt - out of interest - based advertising from our customers, as well as our customers' advertising on Shoclef based on data collected through third party sites, by adjusting your settings. Please note that opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit; it will mean that the ads you see may not be matched to your interests. If you are not a Shoclef member, learn more about cookies and how to opt out. Click here to learn more about the self-regulatory principles we adhere to.

    What third - party cookies does Shoclef use ?

        Our lists some of the third party cookies on our sites. Please note that the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time. Please also note that companies and other organizations that sponsor pages on Shoclef may use cookies, pixels or other technologies on their Shoclef pages to learn about your interest in them.

    We receive requests from users and government agencies to disclose data other than in the ordinary operation and provision of the Services. This Data Request Policy outlines our policies and procedures for responding to such requests for our users’ data.

    Requests for Data by Individuals
As an individual, you should contact the user whose information you seek access to. Each user controls her data and generally gets to decide what to do with her data.

Requests for Data by Legal Authority
    Except as expressly permitted by an agreement or in cases of emergency to avoid death or physical harm to individuals, we will only disclose customer data in response to valid and binding compulsory legal process. We require a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction(a federal court or a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized by the law of that State to issue search warrants) to disclose customer data.

    All requests by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation for customer data disclosures should be sent to legal@shoclef.com and include the following information: (a) the requesting party, (b) the relevant criminal or civil matter, and(c) a description of the specific customer data being requested, including the relevant customer’s name and relevant Authorized User’s name(if applicable), the user’s URL, and type of data sought.

    Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific customer data sought. We will construe all requests narrowly, so please do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. If legally permitted, the requester will be responsible for any costs arising from our response to such requests.

    We are committed to the importance of trust and transparency for the benefit of our users and do not voluntarily provide governments with access to any data about users for surveillance purposes.

Domestication and International Requests
    We require that any individual issuing legal process or legal information requests(e. g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to us properly domesticate the process or request and serve us in a jurisdiction where we are resident or have a registered agent to accept service on our behalf. We do not accept legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside the U. S. or Canada. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where we are located.`,

    ONLINE TRACKING:
    A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. We or our third - party vendors may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other technologies to improve your experience with our website and show you ads based on past visits to our website. We may use cookies and other technologies to improve our understanding of what you like and do not like about our website, customize the website to your prior uses and to generally improve all customer needs and interests.
    We or our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our Services. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit us. Knowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your service, and provide you with better customer service.
    You may choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you may choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your web browser settings. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. You may also delete cookies from your computer or opt out of a third party’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at http: //www. networkadvertising. org/choices/. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.
    As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol(IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider(ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date / time stamp, and clickstream data.
    We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click - through URL” linked to content on our website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click - through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.
    Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.
    We may deliver ads through our advertising platform within our Services and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from our advertising platform, you may choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, where such feature is available. The Limited Ad Tracking, if available, will opt your account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third - party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non - personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the Live Shopping or News Feeds based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third - party apps, you may see ads based on other information.
        LOCATION - BASED SERVICES
    To provide location - based services on our Services, we and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real - time geographic location of your computer or device. Where available, location - based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd - sourced Wi - Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices’ approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location - based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.
    Some location - based services offered by us, such as “Go Live” require your personal information for the feature to work.
        THIRD - PARTY SITES AND SERVICES
    Our Services may contain links to third - party websites, products, and services. Our Services may also use or offer products or services from third parties − for example, a third party app.

    9. SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE SCREENING PROCEDURES AND DISCLAIMERS(DOES NOT APPLY TO FIXED PRICE SERVICES. PLEASE SEE SECTION 12 FOR SCREENING FOR FIXED PRICE SERVICES)
    Unless otherwise noted on the screening tab of a Service Professional's profile page, Shoclef.com uses the following criteria as part of its registration enrollment process (\"registration\") for new Service Professional businesses, with the exception of Corporate Accounts (as described below) and service professionals providing services in Canada (neither of which are screened) applying for membership in our network. We perform the below screening at the time of the Service Professional business' enrollment, and every two years thereafter:
    1. Licensing - We confirm that a prospective new SP business has any applicable required state - level trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers. Certain states may require state - level licensing for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some states, licensing may be required by the county or local authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub - contractors for specific types of work(for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub - contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the unique nature of California licensing, Shoclef relies on representations of service professionals that are using a California General building contracting license to cover home improvement tasks that such service professionals are performing more than one task as defined and required by California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.
2. State Business Filings - For service professionals that are corporations or limited liability companies, we confirm that the business is registered in the state in which it is located.
3. Criminal Records Search - We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner / principal of the company is located, for any relevant criminal convictions associated with the owner / principal of the business, within the three years prior to such service professional's application for membership in the Shoclef network and every two years thereafter. Shoclef's third - party vendor uses a national criminal database(\"NCD\") to screen our service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY. 
4. Sex Offender Search - We check the websites that consolidate state sex offender information in the state in which the owner / principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match based solely on the name of the owner / principal of the company. We do not run sex offender searches in any other states. Please note that only a fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable state sex offender websites for any individuals that will be performing work in your home.
5. Identity Verification(Social Security Number) - Shoclef verifies the social security number of the business owner / principal to confirm their identity. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)
    6. Legal Search for Civil Judgments - We use third party data sources to check, within the 12 months prior to the service professional's application for membership in the Shoclef network, for significant state-level civil legal judgments or liens entered against the owner/principal by business customers and for bankruptcy filings by or against the owner/principal, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located.

    WE PERFORM THE ABOVE SCREENING BASED UPON INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL(E. G. NAME OF OWNER, BIRTHDATE, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER)

    NOTE: Shoclef PERFORMS SCREENING SOLELY AT THE TIME THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL APPLIES FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE Shoclef NETWORK, AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER, AND THEREFORE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S INFORMATION MAY CHANGE OR EXPIRE OVER TIME, AND BETWEEN SCREENINGS. THUS, Shoclef CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT PROFILE AND SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. Shoclef IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S SCREENING INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE WORKING WITH A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL YOU VERIFY THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S PROFILE IS STILL ACCURATE, CURRENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO YOU.

    Corporate Accounts: Some Service Professionals are employees, franchisees, dealers, or independent contractors(\"Corporate SP's\") of larger national or corporate accounts (\"Corporate Accounts\"). In such event, you may be matched with the Corporate Account entity or with one of their Corporate SP's. The above screening criteria is not applicable to Corporate Accounts, and therefore, Shoclef does not screen the Corporate Accounts or Corporate SP's.

Service Professionals Profiles: Shoclef allows Service Professionals to post profiles about themselves and their business on the Shoclef platforms. Shoclef does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self - reported by the Service Professional. Shoclef therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Professional, and assumes no liability for such information.

The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of Shoclef. Shoclef believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members continue to meet the above screening criteria after the date of their enrollment in the Shoclef network. When it comes to screening, every system has its flaws. That is because no background system in the U. S. is one hundred percent accurate. Shoclef does not represent or warrant that the information received from state, provincial or other government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that Shoclef checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real - time basis by such agencies and third party sources.

        DISCLAIMER: Shoclef EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RELATING TO THE SCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE SCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.
10. AFFILIATE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE - SCREENING. While we will not match you with a service professional from our affiliates, we may display to you service professionals from our affiliates, including but not limited to Shoclef. These service professionals have NOT been screened by Shoclef using the screening set forth in Section 10. Rather, these service professionals have been screened as follows:

    Shoclef will only display Shoclef Service professionals that
    1. Have an Overall \"A\" or \"B: rating from member reviews;
    2. Have passed all background checks established by Shoclef(as described below);
    3. Attest that they possess all applicable state and local licensing, registration, or other trade requirements to provide service for the Project or the project described in the Lead; and
    4. Are in good business standing with Shoclef
Shoclef has criminal background checks performed annually on the principal / owner or relevant manager of all \"A\"- and \"B\"-rated companies that are Certified Service Providers, that offer ecommerce offers, that receive leads through the Projects Submissions platform, or that are granted the Super Service Award. The background check currently is performed by American Business Services (\"ABS\"), a third-party screening company. Upon processing the background check, ABS will provide Shoclef with a simple \"pass\" or \"fail\" designation. A failed background check is one that finds one or more of the following: (1) any violent or theft conviction at a felony level in the last 7 years; (2) any sexual felony conviction or on a sexual offender registry at any time (no time limit); or (3) any pending felony charges involving any of types (1) or (2).
    ABS will provide Shoclef with only a pass or fail designation. Shoclef and its members will never see any content from background check results. Since we can only perform these background checks annually, we ask anyone with knowledge of legal, ethical or financial concerns regarding a company contact us by either logging in and selecting Send A Message using our contact form. Shoclef will investigate any information we receive regarding a company's background.
    While we always strive to provide the most current information, we also recommend that you perform your own research on the companies you hire.

11. FIXED PRICE SERVICES
    1. Shoclef(through its affiliate, Handy, Inc.), provides certain services labeled \"Fixed Price Services.\" Through Fixed-Price Services, you will pay for your home service upfront and book the time and date of your service through our secure online portal. Shoclef, THROUGH THE Shoclef PLATFORM, OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO OBTAIN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND/OR MERCHANDISE, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE SUCH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR MERCHANDISE ITSELF OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A RETAILER OR MANUFACTURER, OR AS A CLEANING, HANDYMAN, OR OTHER HOME-RELATED OR MOVING-RELATED SERVICE PROVIDER, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND/OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED TO THE REQUESTER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE. Shoclef IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH, ENDORSED OR SPONSORED BY ANY THIRD PARTY MERCHANDISE PROVIDER OR RETAILER. 
    2. SCREENING FOR FIXED PRICED SERVICES(NOTE: SCREENING FOR STANDARD SERVICES CAN BE FOUND IN SECTION 10).
    For Fixed Price Services, we use a multi - step process to screen potential cleaning and handyman service professionals. The process is designed to filter qualified potential cleaning and handyman service professionals with appropriate backgrounds in compliance with applicable law. The potential cleaning and handyman service professional must provide detailed personal information. These service professionals must provide their full name, address, date of birth, social security number, and a valid form of identification and validate their applicable home services experience. We verify these potential service professional's identities. For Fixed Price Services, we utilize Jumio, an identification verification company, to match the photographs and confirm the integrity of the identification documents. These service professionals then submit to a background check. For Fixed Price Services, we currently use a third-party background check provider, Checkr, Inc., to conduct the background checks.
    Checkr's Background Check Process
    Checkr, a third - party background check provider accredited by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners, conducts a record search which looks back at least seven years or longer in other jurisdictions when permitted by applicable law and available records. Checkr specifically conducts the following checks and searches:
    IDENTITY VERIFICATION Social Security Number(SSN) verification is the most efficient way to verify these potential service professional's identities. If an identity cannot be verified, the Checkr system alerts these potential service professionals to request additional documentation.
    ADDRESS HISTORY Checkr's Identity Check includes a trace of all known domestic addresses over the past seven years. Based on this information, Checkr searches relevant court jurisdictions for the same time period.
    Criminal Records Check
    COUNTY CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK Checkr performs direct searches of county court records. Results include felony and misdemeanor criminal cases as well as, charges, disposition, dates and sentencing information.
    NATIONAL CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK This check scours over 30 million records and is run concurrent with the county criminal records check.
    GLOBAL WATCHLIST CHECK This check searches known domestic and international terrorist watchlists as well as the records of the Office of Inspector General(OIG), Excluded Parties List(EPL) and additional domestic and international agency lists.
    SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY CHECK Checkr searches registries for every state. In certain states, the information publicly available does not include all registered sex offenders and may not include all out - of - state sex offenders, depending on variations in state law.
        Review & Activation
    For Fixed Price Services, we review the background checks in compliance with applicable law before determining whether such applicant should be activated to use the platform.

3. Fixed Price Services Recommendations Explanation. All recommended Fixed Price Professionals have received a \"star\" rating of at least four stars. These Fixed Price Professionals are recommended by other consumers, not by Shoclef.
    4. Fixed Price Payments
    1. Payments. Users of the Shoclef Platform for Fixed Price Services purchased and paid for on the Shoclef website, contract for Professional Services directly with other Users. Shoclef is not a party to any contracts for Professional Services. The Shoclef Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which individuals seeking to obtain services(\"Requesters\") can connect with individuals seeking to provide services (\"Professionals\"), schedule certain services requested by the Requesters, which are to be completed by the Professionals, are hereinafter referred to as \"Professional Services\", and make payments for Professional Services (\"Payments\"). Requesters are obligated to pay in advance for the Professional Services they order through the Shoclef Platform. Prior to the scheduled Professional Service, we will charge the Requester's credit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Shoclef Platform with respect to all Professional Services, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees or expenses associated with a Professional Service as well as the Trust and Support Fee (as defined in Section 12. e. below), and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit card on file in the Requester's Shoclef Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving Shoclef (or a third-party payment processor on Shoclef's behalf) permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you owe Shoclef. Depending on the transaction you selected or services requested, Shoclef may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Professional Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with Shoclef at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester's credit card for an ordered or completed Professional Service transaction. Seventy-two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. If the Requester has agreed with the Professional to extend or reduce the hours in or to reschedule a requested Professional Service, the Requester bears the responsibility for notifying Shoclef. Requesters must notify Shoclef by changing the date or hours of the requested Professional Service through the Shoclef Platform. All Payments by Requesters must be made through the Shoclef Platform. Any Payments paid or Professional Services scheduled outside of the Shoclef Platform are not subject to our Shoclef Happiness Guarantee in Section 12. d. below. Except for the Shoclef Happiness Guarantee in Section 12. d., no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Shoclef's income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Shoclef or third parties, then Shoclef may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Shoclef or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (b) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (c) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (d) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.
2. Job Rate. The rate per hour for a Professional Service(\"Job Rate\") depends on factors, such as location and how frequently a Recurrent Service is ordered, and payment terms may increase. Therefore, the same Professional Service may cost more in a different location or if the Professional Service is ordered less frequently. However, you will be notified prior to any such payment increase with sufficient notice to enable you to cancel the Recurrent Service as set forth herein.
3. Recurrent Service. When requesting a Professional Service, Requesters may have the option of choosing that the Professional Service be repeated on a regular basis(\"Recurrent Service\"). For example, a Requester may choose that a cleaning be performed every two weeks. When a Requester chooses a Recurrent Service, the Shoclef platform will automatically schedule that Recurrent Service to occur on future dates indefinitely at the frequency requested by Requester. Requester's credit card will be charged the same non-promotional amount, as originally disclosed to Requester at the time of signing up for Recurrent Service for the Recurrent Service as the Professional Service appointments occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Shoclef cannot guarantee that the same Professional will be available for each Recurrent Service appointment or that Recurrent Service appointments will not be canceled. Requesters may cancel the Recurrent Service at any time by visiting the Shoclef Contact Center at https: //www. Shoclef.com/contact/https://www. Shoclef.com/contact/ or by mailing a notice of cancellation to Shoclef, Inc. Attn.: Legal, PO Box #1122, New York, NY 10159. Requesters must cancel more than twenty-four hours prior to the Professional Service in order to avoid being charged any cancellation fees and/or for the next Professional Service. After signing up for a Recurrent Service, you will be provided an email acknowledgment which includes information on how to cancel.
5. Shoclef Happiness Guarantee(APPLIES ONLY TO FIXED PRICE SERVICES); Claims
    1. The Shoclef Happiness Guarantee provides certain limited additional protections for Professional Services. Pursuant to the Shoclef Happiness Guarantee and subject to the below terms and conditions and limitations, Shoclef will compensate Requesters: (a) subject to the exclusions below, up to USD \$5,
        000 per occurrence for losses arising from property damage as a direct result of negligence of a Professional during performance of a Professional Service or(b),
 , provided, however, for losses arising from damage to floors and items containing granite, marble or any other stone work as a direct result of negligence of a Professional during performance of a Professional Service the amount shall be limited to up to USD \$1,
        000; or(b) subject to the exclusions below, up to USD \$5,
            000, in the aggregate, for losses arising from theft of a Requester's property by a Professional during performance of a Professional Service.

Shoclef.com/contact/. If the Service Requester does not report the issue within seventy-two (72) hours of the Professional Service appointment, the claim is ineligible for the Shoclef Happiness Guarantee. For Recurring Services, each Professional Service is treated as a separate occurrence.
    2. If you carry insurance that would cover you in the event of a claim, such as renter's insurance, homeowner's insurance, automobile insurance or an umbrella policy(\"Personal Insurance\"), You agree that your Personal Insurance is primary and the Shoclef Happiness Guarantee is secondary.

    Cancellations
    Shoclef Corporation Limited encourages sellers and buyers to mutually resolve disputes within an order and avoid cancellations.
    As a seller, you should do your best to come to a mutual agreement, where both sides are happy with the end result. Cancelling orders negatively affects the buyer experience, and can cause a loss of time and money for the seller.
        Unfortunately, sometimes things just don’t work out, and cancellation is the only way to resolve an order. This solution, however, should be considered a last resort. Therefore, when resolving the issue, please communicate clearly and be polite throughout the cancellation process.
    Resolution Center
    You should make the most of the options offered in theResolution Center. When there is no other way to save the order, you can use the cancellation option.
        Evaluation
    All cancellations are taken into account when evaluating a seller. Shoclef Corporation Limited is aware that some cancellations are inevitable, therefore, those types of cancellations will have a lower impact on your performance scores, which affect your ranking.
    Order Completion
    One of the ways to evaluate a seller’s performance is through their “Order Completion” rate. The Order Completion rate consists of the number of cancellations subtracted from 100 % of the seller’s total of orders, over the last 60 days.
    The Offered Service
    To minimize cancellations, make sure you only provide Orders, which match your skill set. Don’t offer things you cannot do or are not qualified to do.
Service Page
    Be very clear about the pricing and scope of the Service you provide. We recommend that you communicate in a quick and efficient manner with your buyer and make sure you’re aligned on the service being delivered.
        Communication
    When receiving an order, make sure you have all necessary information to start working. If something is not clear, we recommend immediately contacting your buyer for clarification. If cancellation is inevitable, we recommended not waiting until the last minute.
        Delivery
    You should do your best to deliver on time. Plan your work accordingly and make sure your delivery time is realistic. When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. There are cases where sellers will deliver incomplete work to avoid being late, and this behavior is unacceptable. Sending a delivery to avoid being late is a violation of Shoclef Corporation Limited’s Terms of Service and could result in your account being reviewed. Shoclef Corporation Limited encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it’s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.
        Availability
    In cases where you may have personal issues, technical difficulties, or are simply overbooked, we recommend setting your status to Vacation Mode, even if it’s just for a short time. In addition, you can avoid the need to cancel orders, which is a poor experience for our buyers. If you find that you are doing this often, consider limiting yourorders in queueto avoid being overbooked.

    Cancellations And How To Avoid Them
    On Shoclef.com, like in life, things don’t always go as planned, and you’re forced to make a decision you may not have otherwise made. Whether you’re a buyer or Business, there are instances when canceling an order is the only option. Today we’re going to show you a better way.
    But before we tackle ways to prevent order cancellations, let’s look at some frequently asked questions from our community on the types of order cancellations, and how they affect your seller account:
    What Are The Different Types Of Order Cancellations ?
        Shoclef.com Customer Support has detailed information about Shoclef.com’s cancellations policy. Here are some relevant details for sellers to be aware of:

    Promotions Cancellations:
    Buyers can request a cancellation as long as the order isn’t in “status completed”. If the seller doesn’t respond within 48 hours the order will be cancelled. Another option is if an order is late, then a buyer can cancel without the need of the seller’s approval. Cancellations when an order is late can have a negative impact on a seller’s business. This also leaves sellers in a pointF in which they may have worked already, for no pay. For those reasons, this kind of cancellation should be avoided by sending your Order on time.

    Mutual Cancellations:
    This is one way to resolve an order that both parties can’t agree on. If one side requests and the other accepts within 24 hours, then the order is cancelled mutually. If a buyer doesn’t respond within two days of a seller initiating a Mutual Cancellation, the Order is automatically canceled and the cancellation is listed as seller initiated.
    Customer Support: If sellers and buyers don’t agree to a mutual cancellation, then contacting Shoclef.com Customer Support is the next step.
    How Does Cancellations Affect My Ranking ?
        We cannot reveal the exact calculation, however, Shoclef.com doesn’t just look at the amount of cancellations occurred. There are different indicators involved in evaluating cancellations of orders. We look at when the cancellation occurred, if the cancellation could have been avoided, and who the buyer is.
    Cancellations are just one parameter taken into account when evaluating a seller, however, it’s an important one. You, as a seller, should provide high quality service, communicate quickly when needed, provide the deliveries on time, and of course, try to minimize cancellations. With the new analytics page you’ll have a better overview of your performance, and thus, a better opportunity to improve it!
    Now that we’ve covered the basics, take a look below at the situations and the corresponding steps you can take as a seller, to help prevent cancellations. Essentially, these are your seller lifelines and guidelines. We suggest you use them often.
    The Buyer Ordered By Mistake Or Ordered Twice.
    In this case, it’s the buyer responsibility to cancel the order. However, if the buyer does not cancel the order, we recommend using the Resolution Center to initiate cancellation.
        FAQ: A buyer was abusive and kept demanding and ordering things I don’t provide and my only option was to cancel, will this cancellation affect me ?
            Order understands that some orders may result in cancellations because the buyer is difficult to work with. Therefore, Order “flags” those buyers with a history of poor collaboration, and these cancellation won’t count against you.
    The Buyer Has Not Submitted The Full Requirements.
    The seller should ask the buyer for clarifications. We strongly recommend to do so once the requirements are sent and not wait until the last minute where the only option is to cancel. The seller should evaluate the Order requirements and make sure they’re clear and cover all the information, which is required to start the order.
    The Buyer Requested Work, Which Is Beyond The Scope Of This Order Or Costs More Than What Was Actually Paid.
    The seller should clearly explain the difference between the price the buyer paid and what the seller is offering.

    The seller can modify the order in the Resolution Center and add relevant extras to reflect the scope of the work requested.

    If this cannot be done within the current order, the seller should send the buyer the relevant Order or a custom offer and initiate cancellation.

    The seller should also review the Order title, description, pricing, requirements and gallery and make sure they accurately represent the scope of the work the seller provides. The seller should update the FAQs to answer most common questions buyers may have.
    The Buyer Requested Work, Which The Seller Is Not Qualified To Do Or Not Offered In This Order.
    • In this case, when a seller receives an order they can’t do and the only option is to cancel it, the seller needs to initiate a dispute quickly. In addition, the seller should let the buyer know that they can’t perform this job. Order understands that in some case a seller receives orders, which aren’t offered, but it’s the seller’s responsibility to communicate quickly that they can’t or won’t do it.

        FAQ: Many times I receive orders from buyers who don’t understand my service and ask for things I don’t offer. Therefore, I need to cancel the order, so why do you count all cancellations ?
            Order monitors all aspects of an order and why it was cancelled. We take this into consideration when evaluating cancellations. As a seller, you should do your best to avoid cancellations and make sure the percentage of cancellations from your total orders is low. Order is aware that there are cases when cancellations are the only option.
    The Buyer Is Not Responding And I Need Their Feedback To Progress With The Order.
    The seller should write the buyer again. If no response is received within two to three days before the set delivery date, you should use the Resolution Center and request to extend the delivery time. If the buyer is still unresponsive, the seller may use the Resolution Center to cancel the order.
    The Buyer Wasn’t Satisfied With The Final Delivery.
    • If this Order includes revisions, the seller should try to work things out with the buyer and understand what updates are required to improve this delivery.
    •
    The seller can send a custom offer to the buyer for the cost of a revision.
    •
    The seller must review the Order gallery, offered package, pricing, and Order description and make sure they represent the quality of work the seller provides.`,

You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on other user or our business partners’ behalf.

    Commitment to Security

    At Shoclef Corporation Limited, a Hong Kong Limited Corporation, and its subsidiaries in different countries, we are committed to maintaining the security of our systems and data. We believe that good security is critical to maintaining the trust of our customers, merchants and employees. As such, we strive to continuously improve our security to ensure that we are prepared to meet the challenges posed by an ever - evolving threat landscape.

    Bug Bounty Program

    We value your input. When properly notified of a security issue we are committed to working with you to understand and remediate verified problems. If you believe you find an issue on our site, we encourage you to report it to us in a private and responsible way. In order to encourage this, we have established a reward program which will pay a bounty for verifiable security issues reported to us through the proper channel.

    What Vulnerabilities Qualify for the Bounty ?

        Although not an exhaustive list, any issue that potentially affects the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of our customer's data will be considered for a bounty. Some examples of those types of issues include:
    Cross - site scripting(XSS).
        Cross - site request forgery(CSRF).
            SQL / Code Injection.
    Issues identified with our authentication or session management mechanisms.

    Which Sites Qualify for the Bounty ?
        www. shoclef.com
www. shoclef. org
www. shoclef. info
    www. shoclef. net
    www. shoclefinternational.com
    www. shoclefcorporation.com
    Similarly, we also have a number of issues for which we will generally not pay out a bounty - and which include anything that reports an act that is abusive or in bad faith. These include:
    Bugs identified via off - the - shelf vulnerability or security scanners including open source / free / or commercial tools, i. e. burpsuite, Websecurify, Zed, Wikto.
    Information revealed that may be interesting from a security standpoint but does not represent a security issue in -and - of itself. This includes but is not limited to: reporting on open ports, SSL Labs output, and stack traces that disclose information.
    Infrastructure attacks, including brute force or denial of service.
    Issues that require physical access, social engineering, and / or manual steps that a user would never execute on their own(i. e. copying scripts into a debug console).
    Tools that generate significant amount of traffic volume or any activity deemed to disruptive to other users.
    Attacks against other user accounts(target your own account only)
    Issues that we are already fixing or that someone else has previously reported
    Issues that are only exploited with old and typically - unused software, such as XSS that can only be exploited using an outdated browser.
    Open redirects. For the instances where the impact results in the exposure of sensitive information or login compromise, please submit them and we will analyze from there.

    Content Injection Issues

    Fraud - related issues are not part of the program.
    Underspecified reports where the information provided is insufficient to reproduce the vulnerability
    Functionality bugs which do not compromise the security of our users’ accounts or personal information.
    Bugs that have been disclosed publicly or to third parties(brokers) by you or others
    Vulnerabilities on sites that are not owned or operated by Shoclef International SA
    Testing a suspected vulnerability in a way that violates any law or compromises data that is not your own POC videos or other materials that prove the issue have been uploaded to third party website, even if marked as not publicly searchable.

    Reporting Suspected Vulnerabilities

    If you believe that you have found a vulnerability, please report it to disclosures@shoclef.com. A written description is required if you are sending a POC video. Our security team will interact with you directly from there. We encourage the use of encryption in your communications with us and ask that you encrypt your message to us whenever possible. Our public PGP key can be downloaded from here and is located at the bottom of this page.

        Terms

    In addition to the information provided above, the following Terms also apply to your participation in Shoclef’s Responsible Disclosure Program. Please note that whether to award bounties and the bounty awarded for identified issues will vary and remain at all times at Shoclef International SA discretion. If multiple vulnerabilities are reported or are closely related, we may choose to only award a single bounty. We may choose not to award bounties when we launch new products for a beta period, or otherwise are actively in a development or upkeep cycle. We may also require documentation for tax reporting purposes before we are able to pay certain bounties and we are unable to award bounties to individuals or in situations where to do so would violate a sanction list maintained by the U. S. Office of Foreign Assets Control(“OFAC”) or conflict with the letter or spirit of other applicable State, Federal or Territorial law, rule or regulation. Notwithstanding any of the above, Shoclef International SA reserves the right to cancel or modify this program at any time and without notice.

        Confidentiality

    Any information you receive or collect about Shoclef International SA, its affiliates or any of their users, employees or agents in connection with the Bug Bounty Program(“Confidential Information”) must be kept confidential and only used in connection with the Bug Bounty Program.
