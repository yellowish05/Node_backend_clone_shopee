<h1><u>Cancellations</u></h1>
<p>Shoclef Corporation Limited encourages sellers and buyers to mutually resolve disputes within an order and avoid cancellations.</p>
<p>As a seller, you should do your best to come to a mutual agreement, where both sides are happy with the end result. Cancelling orders negatively affects the buyer experience, and can cause a loss of time and money for the seller.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes things just don&rsquo;t work out, and cancellation is the only way to resolve an order. This solution, however, should be considered a last resort. Therefore, when resolving the issue, please communicate clearly and be polite throughout the cancellation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Resolution Center</u></p>
<p>You should make the most of the options offered in theResolution Center. When there is no other way to save the order, you can use the cancellation option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Evaluation</u></p>
<p>All cancellations are taken into account when evaluating a seller. Shoclef Corporation Limited is aware that some cancellations are inevitable, therefore, those types of cancellations will have a lower impact on your performance scores, which affect your ranking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Order Completion</u></p>
<p>One of the ways to evaluate a seller&rsquo;s performance is through their &ldquo;Order Completion&rdquo; rate. The Order Completion rate consists of the number of cancellations subtracted from 100% of the seller&rsquo;s total of orders, over the last 60 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The Offered Service</u></p>
<p>To minimize cancellations, make sure you only provide Orders, which match your skill set. Don&rsquo;t offer things you cannot do or are not qualified to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Service Page</u></p>
<p>Be very clear about the pricing and scope of the Service you provide. We recommend that you communicate in a quick and efficient manner with your buyer and make sure you&rsquo;re aligned on the service being delivered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Communication</u></p>
<p>When receiving an order, make sure you have all necessary information to start working. If something is not clear, we recommend immediately contacting your buyer for clarification. If cancellation is inevitable, we recommended not waiting until the last minute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Delivery</u></p>
<p>You should do your best to deliver on time. Plan your work accordingly and make sure your delivery time is realistic. When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. There are cases where sellers will deliver incomplete work to avoid being late, and this behavior is unacceptable. Sending a delivery to avoid being late is a violation of Shoclef Corporation Limited&rsquo;s Terms of Service and could result in your account being reviewed. Shoclef Corporation Limited encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it&rsquo;s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Availability</u></p>
<p>In cases where you may have personal issues, technical difficulties, or are simply overbooked, we recommend setting your status to Vacation Mode, even if it&rsquo;s just for a short time. In addition, you can avoid the need to cancel orders, which is a poor experience for our buyers. If you find that you are doing this often, consider limiting yourorders in queueto avoid being overbooked.</p>

<h1><u>Cancellations And How To Avoid Them</u></h1>
<p>On Shoclef.com, like in life, things don&rsquo;t always go as planned, and you&rsquo;re forced to make a decision you may not have otherwise made. Whether you&rsquo;re a buyer or Business, there are instances when canceling an order is the only option. Today we&rsquo;re going to show you a better way.</p>
<p>But before we tackle ways to prevent order cancellations, let&rsquo;s look at some frequently asked questions from our community on the types of order cancellations, and how they affect your seller account:</p>
<h4><u>What Are The Different Types Of Order Cancellations?</u></h4>
<p>Shoclef.com Customer Support has detailed information about Shoclef.com&rsquo;s cancellations policy. Here are some relevant details for sellers to be aware of:</p>
<p><u><br /> Promotions Cancellations:</u></p>
<p>Buyers can request a cancellation as long as the order isn&rsquo;t in &ldquo;status completed&rdquo;. If the seller doesn&rsquo;t respond within 48 hours the order will be cancelled. Another option is if an order is late, then a buyer can cancel without the need of the seller&rsquo;s approval. Cancellations when an order is late can have a negative impact on a seller&rsquo;s business. This also leaves sellers in a position in which they may have worked already, for no pay. For those reasons, this kind of cancellation should be avoided by sending your Order on time.</p>
<p><br /> <u>&nbsp;Mutual Cancellations:</u></p>
<p>This is one way to resolve an order that both parties can&rsquo;t agree on. If one side requests and the other accepts within 24 hours, then the order is cancelled mutually. If a buyer doesn&rsquo;t respond within two days of a seller initiating a Mutual Cancellation, the Order is automatically canceled and the cancellation is listed as seller initiated.<br /> Customer Support: If sellers and buyers don&rsquo;t agree to a mutual cancellation, then contacting Shoclef.com Customer Support is the next step<u>.</u></p>
<h4><u>How Does Cancellations Affect My Ranking?</u></h4>
<p>We cannot reveal the exact calculation, however, Shoclef.com doesn&rsquo;t just look at the amount of cancellations occurred. There are different indicators involved in evaluating cancellations of orders. We look at when the cancellation occurred, if the cancellation could have been avoided, and who the buyer is.</p>
<p>Cancellations are just one parameter taken into account when evaluating a seller, however, it&rsquo;s an important one. You, as a seller, should provide high quality service, communicate quickly when needed, provide the deliveries on time, and of course, try to minimize cancellations. With the new analytics page you&rsquo;ll have a better overview of your performance, and thus, a better opportunity to improve it!</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the basics, take a look below at the situations and the corresponding steps you can take as a seller, to help prevent cancellations. Essentially, these are your seller lifelines and guidelines. We suggest you use them often.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Ordered By Mistake Or Ordered Twice.</u></h4>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s the buyer responsibility to cancel the order. However, if the buyer does not cancel the order, we recommend using the Resolution Center to initiate cancellation.</p>
<p>FAQ: A buyer was abusive and kept demanding and ordering things I don&rsquo;t provide and my only option was to cancel, will this cancellation affect me?<br /> Order understands that some orders may result in cancellations because the buyer is difficult to work with. Therefore, Order &ldquo;flags&rdquo; those buyers with a history of poor collaboration, and these cancellation won&rsquo;t count against you.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Has Not Submitted The Full Requirements.</u></h4>
<p>The seller should ask the buyer for clarifications. We strongly recommend to do so once the requirements are sent and not wait until the last minute where the only option is to cancel. The seller should evaluate the Order requirements and make sure they&rsquo;re clear and cover all the information, which is required to start the order.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Requested Work, Which Is Beyond The Scope Of This Order Or Costs More Than What Was Actually Paid.</u></h4>
<p>The seller should clearly explain the difference between the price the buyer paid and what the seller is offering.</p>
<p><br /> The seller can modify the order in the Resolution Center and add relevant extras to reflect the scope of the work requested.</p>
<p><br /> If this cannot be done within the current order, the seller should send the buyer the relevant Order or a custom offer and initiate cancellation.</p>
<p><br /> The seller should also review the Order title, description, pricing, requirements and gallery and make sure they accurately represent the scope of the work the seller provides. The seller should update the FAQs to answer most common questions buyers may have.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Requested Work, Which The Seller Is Not Qualified To Do Or Not Offered In This Order.</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>In this case, when a seller receives an order they can&rsquo;t do and the only option is to cancel it, the seller needs to initiate a dispute quickly. In addition, the seller should let the buyer know that they can&rsquo;t perform this job. Order understands that in some case a seller receives orders, which aren&rsquo;t offered, but it&rsquo;s the seller&rsquo;s responsibility to communicate quickly that they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do it.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> FAQ: Many times I receive orders from buyers who don&rsquo;t understand my service and ask for things I don&rsquo;t offer. Therefore, I need to cancel the order, so why do you count all cancellations?<br /> Order monitors all aspects of an order and why it was cancelled. We take this into consideration when evaluating cancellations. As a seller, you should do your best to avoid cancellations and make sure the percentage of cancellations from your total orders is low. Order is aware that there are cases when cancellations are the only option.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Is Not Responding And I Need Their Feedback To Progress With The Order.</u></h4>
<p>The seller should write the buyer again. If no response is received within two to three days before the set delivery date, you should use the Resolution Center and request to extend the delivery time. If the buyer is still unresponsive, the seller may use the Resolution Center to cancel the order.</p>
<h4><u>The Buyer Wasn&rsquo;t Satisfied With The Final Delivery.</u></h4>
<ul>
<li>If this Order includes revisions, the seller should try to work things out with the buyer and understand what updates are required to improve this delivery.</li>
<li>The seller can send a custom offer to the buyer for the cost of a revision.</li>
<li>The seller must review the Order gallery, offered package, pricing, and Order description and make sure they represent the quality of work the seller provides.</li>
</ul>
