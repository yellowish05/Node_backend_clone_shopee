<p>We may make a good faith attempt to forward the written notification, including the complainant&rsquo;s contact information, to the user who posted the content or take other reasonable steps to notify the user that we have received notice of an alleged violation of intellectual property rights or other content violation. It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post unlawful content.</p>

<p>Any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury. A false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability. You may therefore want to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or a counter-notice.</p>
