<p><strong>Online Tracking:</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small removable data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer. We or our third-party vendors may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other technologies to improve your experience with our website and show you ads based on past visits to our website. We may use cookies and other technologies to improve our understanding of what you like and do not like about our website, customize the website to your prior uses and to generally improve all customer needs and interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We or our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our Services. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit us. Knowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience. Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your contact information, hardware identifiers, and information about your computer or device helps us personalize your operating system, set up your service, and provide you with better customer service.</p>
<p>You may choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or you may choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your web browser settings. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services will not function properly. You may also delete cookies from your computer or opt out of a third party&rsquo;s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page at&nbsp; http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.&nbsp;We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.&nbsp; However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.</p>
<p>As is true of most internet services, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit websites and applications, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>
<p>In some of our email messages, we use a &ldquo;click-through URL&rdquo; linked to content on our website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>
<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>
<p>We may deliver ads through our advertising platform within our Services and in the App Store. If you do not wish to receive ads targeted to your interests from our advertising platform, you may choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking, where such feature is available. The Limited Ad Tracking, if available, will opt your account out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. If you enable Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third-party apps cannot use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier, to serve you targeted ads. You may still see ads in the Live Shopping or News Feeds based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. In third-party apps, you may see ads based on other information.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION-BASED SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>To provide location-based services on our Services, we and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device. Where available, location-based services may use GPS, Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations, and other technologies to determine your devices&rsquo; approximate location. Unless you provide consent, this location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us&nbsp; and our partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and services. For example, your device may share its geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>
<p>Some location-based services offered by us, such as &ldquo;Go Live&rdquo; require your personal information for the feature to work.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our Services may also use or offer products or services from third parties &minus; for example, a third party app.</p>
<p>Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURES</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; standard is still in development and not yet finalized.&nbsp; We will only collect and use the personal information you provide to us pursuant to the terms in this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure and Sharing Your Personal Information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share your information with our partners and other users for them to provide or offer their services or products, for us to provide or improve our Services, for us to market to our customers, or as permitted under this privacy policy. For example, when you create a user account and log in, you authorize us and your carrier to exchange the information you provide during the activation process to carry out service. We share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever we operate.</p>
<p>In the event we reorganize or transfer to a third party, your personal information may be transferred to our successor for the purposes and subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We may provide your credit card (or other authorized payment method) information to our bank or credit card or other authorized payment processor solely for purposes of processing your payment. On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others&rsquo; rights, property, or safety. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Your Information:</strong></p>
<p>We use technological security measures to preserve the security of your information, including without limitation, encryption technologies and authentication tools. Your personal information is contained behind secure networks and is only accessible to a limited number of persons who have a need to access your personal information for purposes of managing our website and providing you information as you have requested. All orders are placed through a secure server. Please be aware that no electronic data transmission over the internet can be 100% secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use our Services or post on our forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.</p>
<p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring Your Information Overseas:</strong></p>
<p>We may transfer your information to our family of companies, to other service providers or distributors outside of your country or territory. We have teams worldwide, including in the United States. We acknowledge that the data protection laws governing our services may not be as comprehensive as those of your country or territory and we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights are respected.&nbsp; When transferring personal data outside of the European Union, we require all third parties that are not our affiliates to agree to the<u> <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm">EU Model Contracts</a></u>, or contracts with similar provisions and safeguards.</p>
