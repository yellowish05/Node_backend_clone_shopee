<p>We receive requests from users and government agencies to disclose data other than in the ordinary operation and provision of the Services. This Data Request Policy outlines our policies and procedures for responding to such requests for our users&rsquo; data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests for Data by Individuals</strong></p>
<p>As an individual, you should contact the user whose information you seek access to. Each user controls her data and generally gets to decide what to do with her data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests for Data by Legal Authority</strong></p>
<p>Except as expressly permitted by an agreement or in cases of emergency to avoid death or physical harm to individuals, we will only disclose customer data in response to valid and binding compulsory legal process. We require a search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (a federal court or a court of general criminal jurisdiction of a State authorized by the law of that State to issue search warrants) to disclose customer data.</p>
<p>All requests by courts, government agencies, or parties involved in litigation for customer data disclosures should be sent to <a href="mailto:legal@shoclef.com">legal@shoclef.com</a> and include the following information: (a) the requesting party, (b) the relevant criminal or civil matter, and (c) a description of the specific customer data being requested, including the relevant customer&rsquo;s name and relevant Authorized User&rsquo;s name (if applicable), the user&rsquo;s URL, and type of data sought.</p>
<p>Requests should be prepared and served in accordance with applicable law. All requests should be narrow and focused on the specific customer data sought. We will construe all requests narrowly, so please do not submit unnecessarily broad requests. If legally permitted, the requester will be responsible for any costs arising from our response to such requests.</p>
<p>We are committed to the importance of trust and transparency for the benefit of our users and do not voluntarily provide governments with access to any data about users for surveillance purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Domestication and International Requests</strong></p>
<p>We require that any individual issuing legal process or legal information requests (e.g., discovery requests, warrants, or subpoenas) to us properly domesticate the process or request and serve us in a jurisdiction where we are resident or have a registered agent to accept service on our behalf. We do not accept legal process or requests directly from law enforcement entities outside the U.S. or Canada. Foreign law enforcement agencies should proceed through a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty or other diplomatic or legal means to obtain data through a court where we are located.</p>
