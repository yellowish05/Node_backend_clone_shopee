<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; color: black;">Shoclef Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries in different countries</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> encourages sellers and buyers to mutually resolve disputes within an order and avoid cancellations.</span></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">As a seller, you should do your best to come to a mutual agreement, where both sides are happy with the end result. Cancelling orders negatively affects the buyer experience, and can cause a loss of time and money for the seller.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Unfortunately, sometimes things just don&rsquo;t work out, and cancellation is the only way to resolve an order. This solution, however, should be considered a last resort. Therefore, when resolving the issue, please communicate clearly and be polite throughout the cancellation process.</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Resolution Center</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">You should make the most of the options offered in the&nbsp;Resolution Center. When there is no other way to save the order, you can use the cancellation option.</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Evaluation&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">All cancellations are taken into account when evaluating a seller. Shoclef is aware that some cancellations are inevitable, therefore, those types of cancellations will have a lower impact on your performance scores, which affect your ranking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Order Completion&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">One of the ways to evaluate a seller&rsquo;s performance is through their &ldquo;Order Completion&rdquo; rate. The Order Completion rate consists of the number of cancellations subtracted from 100% of the seller&rsquo;s total of orders, over the last 60 days.</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">The Offered Service</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">To minimize cancellations, make sure you only provide Orders, which match your skill set. Don&rsquo;t offer things you cannot do or are not qualified to do.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Gig Page</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">As a seller, you should accurately display your latest work and set reasonable delivery times. This is crucial in helping you to provide high quality deliveries to your buyers. Be very clear about the pricing and scope of the Service you provide. We recommend that you communicate in a quick and efficient manner with your buyer and make sure you&rsquo;re aligned on the service being delivered.</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Communication</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">When receiving an order, make sure you have all necessary information to start working. If something is not clear, we recommend immediately contacting your buyer for clarification. If cancellation is inevitable, we recommended not waiting until the last minute.</span></p>

<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Delivery</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">You should do your best to deliver on time. Plan your work accordingly and make sure your delivery time is realistic. When an order is very late, it will automatically be canceled resulting in negative feedback. There are cases where sellers will deliver incomplete work to avoid being late, and this behavior is unacceptable. Sending a delivery to avoid being late is a violation of Shoclef&rsquo;s Terms of Service and could result in your account being reviewed. Shoclef&rsquo;s encourages sellers to deliver on time. However, if it&rsquo;s not possible, then we recommend using the extended delivery time option offered in the Resolution Center.</span></p>
<p class="Textbody"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Availability&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="Textbody"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">In cases where you may have personal issues, technical difficulties, or are simply overbooked, we recommend setting your status to Vacation Mode, even if it&rsquo;s just for a short time. In addition, you can avoid the need to cancel orders, which is a poor experience for our buyers. If you find that you are doing this often, consider limiting your&nbsp;orders in queue&nbsp;to avoid being overbooked.</span></p>
