<p>At Shoclef, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and use data related to you. This cookie policy applies to any Shoclef product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Does Shoclef use cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. As described in<u> Privacy Policy,</u> we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses Shoclef.com has the best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables Shoclef.com features and functionality. For example, cookies enable us to identify your device, secure your access to Shoclef and our sites generally, and even help us know if someone attempts to access your account from a different device. Cookies also enable you to easily share content on Shoclef and help us serve relevant ads to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When does Shoclef place cookies?</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies on our sites (such as Shoclef .com and slideshare.net) and mobile applications. Any browser visiting these sites will receive cookies from us. We also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-Shoclef sites that host our plugins (for example, Shoclef 's "Share" button) or tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What types of cookies does Shoclef use?</strong></p>
<p>We use two types: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it's easier to return to Shoclef or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by Shoclef when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services (for example, our sharing or job application buttons). Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Which Shoclef entity is using cookies?</strong></p>
<p>If you reside in the United States, Shoclef Inc. will be responsible for your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services. If you reside outside the United States, Shoclef will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, our Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies used for?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit Shoclef.com, remember your preferences, and give you a personalized experience that's in line with your settings. Cookies also make your interactions with Shoclef faster and more secure. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Shoclef sites, and bring customized features to you through Shoclef plugins such as our "Share" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Categories of Use</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong></p>
<p>If you're signed in to Shoclef.com, cookies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies to enable and support our security features, and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preferences, features and services</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. They can help you fill out forms on Shoclef more easily. They also provide you with features, insights, and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. You can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We may use cookies to show you relevant advertising both on and off the Shoclef site. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on the advertiser's site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we've shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads. We may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off Shoclef, such as after you've visited a partner's site or application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Performance, Analytics, and Research</strong></p>
<p>Cookies help us learn how well our site and plugins perform in different locations. We also use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access Shoclef from other websites, applications, or devices such as your work computer or your mobile device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is Do Not Track (DNT)?</strong></p>
<p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, Shoclef does not generally respond to "do not track" signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How are cookies used for advertising purposes?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. Note: Because your web browser may request advertisements and beacons directly from third party ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set third party cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Ads served by Shoclef may also set third party cookies.</p>
<p>If you are logged in on Shoclef.com, the Shoclef app or another Service that references this Cookie Policy or browsing a third party partner site of Shoclef and one of our cookies on your device identifies you, your usage (such as your browsing behavior) and log data (such as your IP address), will be associated by us with your account as noted in Section 1.3 of our Privacy Policy. We also use aggregate data from third parties and data from your profile and Shoclef activity.</p>
<p>If you are a Shoclef member but logged out of your account on a browser, Shoclef may still continue to log your interaction with our services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our services, which analytics we may share in aggregate form with our advertising customers.</p>
<p>Unless you clear these cookies from your browser, we may use this information to:</p>
<p>provide more relevant, interest-based advertising</p>
<p>provide aggregate reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads</p>
<p>help website and app owners understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps</p>
<p>detect and defend against fraud and other risks to protect users and partners</p>
<p>improve our products</p>
<p>We do not provide any personal information that we collect to advertisers unless you have given us permission to do so. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising from our customers, as well as our customers' advertising on Shoclef based on data collected through third party sites, by adjusting your settings. Please note that opting out will not remove advertising from the pages you visit; it will mean that the ads you see may not be matched to your interests. If you are not a Shoclef member, learn more about cookies and how to opt out. Click here to learn more about the self-regulatory principles we adhere to.</p>

<p><strong>What third-party cookies does Shoclef use?</strong></p>
<p>Our lists some of the third party cookies on our sites. Please note that the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time. Please also note that companies and other organizations that sponsor pages on Shoclef may use cookies, pixels or other technologies on their Shoclef pages to learn about your interest in them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Controlling cookies</strong></p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. However, if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
