<p>We want Shoclef to continue to be an authentic and safe place for our community. Help us foster this community. Post only your own coontent and always follow the law and our <u>Terms of Use</u>. Respect everyone on Shoclef, don&rsquo;t spam people or post illegal content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Shoclef, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As always, you own the content you post on Shoclef. Remember to post authentic content, and don&rsquo;t post anything you&rsquo;ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don&rsquo;t have the right to post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shoclef is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering sexual services, buying or selling firearms and illegal or prescription drugs (even if it&rsquo;s legal in your region) is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods. Accounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate images of others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.</p>
<p>The Shoclef community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and we&rsquo;ll remove it or disable accounts if it&rsquo;s reported to us. We may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of us is an important part of the Shoclef community. If you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by reporting these violations. When you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may work with law enforcement, including when we believe that there&rsquo;s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.</p>
