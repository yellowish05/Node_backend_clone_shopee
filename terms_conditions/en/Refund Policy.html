<p><strong>THE STANDARD SERVICES (FIXED PRICE SERVICES ARE SET FORTH IN SECTION 12)</strong><br /> At Shoclef we are committed to making your total Shoclef experience a positive one. There are several ways you can find service professionals through Shoclef (collectively, "Service Professionals"). Profinder is our service where you request a referral for a specific task, and we refer you to up to four Service Professionals. Also you may select or search for individual Service Professionals from our Live Directory (a.k.a. Pro Reviews), a directory of Service Professional members along with their ratings and reviews.</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon entering your information and the request for which you would like a Service Professional, we will attempt to match you with up to four Service Professionals in your area, who may be interested in fulfilling your service need. However, we do not guarantee that we will be able to match your service needs with a Service Professional or that there are Service Professionals in your area that are either capable or willing to complete your service needs.</li>
<li>LiveDirectory (a.k.a. ProReviews).&nbsp;You can view a directory of Service Professionals in your selected zip code who provide services in the project categories that you select. These listings include ratings and reviews of those Service Professionals from their customers, when available.</li>
<li>Instant Connect.&nbsp;With Instant Connect, you can request that Shoclef connect you with a Service Professional by phone immediately. If you request, Shoclef will search for a Service Professional and connect you with them by phone.</li>
<li>Instant Booking.&nbsp;You can choose to schedule appointments with certain of our Service Professionals right on the Shoclef website. Please be aware that Shoclef does not guarantee that the Service Professionals will be on time for, or show up for, any such booked appointments, as the Service Professionals are not the employees, contractors or agents of Shoclef. Shoclef is solely providing the platform to facilitate scheduling of appointments between you and the Service Professionals.</li>
<li>No Guarantees or Endorsements.&nbsp;Although we take certain steps to examine the credentials of the Service Professionals listed on our website or whom you may book using our Services, we make no guarantees, warranties or representations regarding the skills or undertakings of such Service Professional or the quality of the job that he or she may perform for you if you elect to retain their services.&nbsp;Shoclef does not endorse or recommend the services of any particular Service Professional.&nbsp;Except as set forth below in Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 12, we do not independently verify their representations about their services, nor validate any reviews. It is entirely up to you to evaluate the Service Professional and the Service Professional's qualifications, and to enter into a direct contract or otherwise reach agreement with a Service Professional. We do not guarantee or warrant any Service Professional's performance on the job or the outcome or quality of the services performed. The Service Professionals are not employees or agents of Shoclef, nor is Shoclef an agent of the Service Professionals.</li>
<li>No Contracting via the Shoclef Website.&nbsp;Shoclef may inform you of certain offers or discounts provided by a Service Professional. Such offers or discounts are made solely by the Service Professional, and Shoclef does not guarantee or warrant the pricing or discounts that a Service Professional may offer you. Any quotes provided by Service Professionals via the Shoclef or apps, or which you find on the Shoclef or apps, are not contractually binding offers, are for informational purposes only, and cannot be accepted on or via Shoclef. No contractual arrangement is created based upon the quotes provided to you from Service Professionals (or your scheduling of an appointment with a Service Professional) via Shoclef. To contract with a Service Professional, you must work directly with the Service Professional. Shoclef does not perform, and is not responsible for, any of the Services requested by you in your service request. Your rights under contracts you enter into with Service Professionals are governed by the terms of such contracts and by applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. Shoclef is not a party to such agreements. All payments and applicable taxes must be made to the Service Professional in accordance with the agreements.</li>
<li>Release from Damages or Claims.&nbsp;Should you have a dispute with respect to any services provided by a Service Professional or the fees charged by any Service Professional, you must address such dispute with the Service Professional directly (although you may copy Shoclef on the fee disputes). YOU HEREBY AGREE TO RELEASE SHOCLEF (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) FROM ANY DAMAGES OR CLAIMS (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, AND DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES AND YOUR DEALINGS WITH SERVICE PROFESSIONALS.</li>

<li><strong>SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE SCREENING PROCEDURES AND DISCLAIMERS (DOES NOT APPLY TO FIXED PRICE SERVICES. PLEASE SEE SECTION 12 FOR SCREENING FOR FIXED PRICE SERVICES)</strong><br /> Unless otherwise noted on the screening tab of a Service Professional's profile page, Shoclef.com uses the following criteria as part of its registration enrollment process ("registration") for new Service Professional businesses, with the exception of Corporate Accounts (as described below) and service professionals providing services in Canada (neither of which are screened) applying for membership in our network.&nbsp;We perform the below screening at the time of the Service Professional business' enrollment, and every two years thereafter:
<ol>
<li>Licensing -&nbsp;We confirm that a prospective new SP business has any applicable required state-level trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers. Certain states may require state-level licensing for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some states, licensing may be required by the county or local authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the unique nature of California licensing, Shoclef relies on representations of service professionals that are using a California General building contracting license to cover home improvement tasks that such service professionals are performing more than one task as defined and required by California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.</li>
<li>State Business Filings -&nbsp;For service professionals that are corporations or limited liability companies, we confirm that the business is registered in the state in which it is located.</li>
<li>Criminal Records Search -&nbsp;We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for any relevant criminal convictions associated with the owner/principal of the business, within the three years prior to such service professional's application for membership in the Shoclef network and every two years thereafter. Shoclef's third-party vendor uses a national criminal database ("NCD") to screen our service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sex Offender Search -&nbsp;We check the websites that consolidate state sex offender information in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match based solely on the name of the owner/principal of the company. We do not run sex offender searches in any other states. Please note that only a fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable state sex offender websites for any individuals that will be performing work in your home.</li>
<li>Identity Verification (Social Security Number) -&nbsp;Shoclef verifies the social security number of the business owner/principal to confirm their identity. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)</li>
<li>Legal Search for Civil Judgments -&nbsp;We use third party data sources to check, within the 12 months prior to the service professional's application for membership in the Shoclef network, for significant state-level civil legal judgments or liens entered against the owner/principal by business customers and for bankruptcy filings by or against the owner/principal, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located.<br /> <br /> WE PERFORM THE ABOVE SCREENING BASED UPON INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL (E.G. NAME OF OWNER, BIRTHDATE, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER)<br /> <br /> NOTE: SHOCLEF PERFORMS SCREENING SOLELY AT THE TIME THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL APPLIES FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE SHOCLEF NETWORK,&nbsp;AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER, AND THEREFORE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S INFORMATION MAY CHANGE OR EXPIRE OVER TIME, AND BETWEEN SCREENINGS. THUS, SHOCLEF CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT PROFILE AND SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. Shoclef IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S SCREENING INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE WORKING WITH A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL YOU VERIFY THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S PROFILE IS STILL ACCURATE, CURRENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO YOU.<br /> <br /> Corporate Accounts:&nbsp;Some Service Professionals are employees, franchisees, dealers, or independent contractors ("Corporate SP's") of larger national or corporate accounts ("Corporate Accounts"). In such event, you may be matched with the Corporate Account entity or with one of their Corporate SP's.&nbsp;The above screening criteria is not applicable to Corporate Accounts, and therefore, Shoclef does not screen the Corporate Accounts or Corporate SP's.<br /> <br /> Service Professionals Profiles: Shoclef allows Service Professionals to post profiles about themselves and their business on the Shoclef platforms. Shoclef does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self-reported by the Service Professional. Shoclef therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Professional, and assumes no liability for such information.<br /> <br /> The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of Shoclef. Shoclef believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members continue to meet the above screening criteria after the date of their enrollment in the Shoclef network. When it comes to screening, every system has its flaws. That is because no background system in the U.S. is one hundred percent accurate. Shoclef does not represent or warrant that the information received from state, provincial or other government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that Shoclef checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real-time basis by such agencies and third party sources.<br /> <br /> DISCLAIMER: SHOCLEF EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RELATING TO THE SCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE SCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.</li>

<li><strong>AFFILIATE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE-SCREENING</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While we will not match you with a service professional from our affiliates, we may display to you service professionals from our affiliates, including but not limited to Shoclef.&nbsp;These service professionals have NOT been screened by Shoclef&nbsp;using the screening set forth in Section 10.&nbsp;Rather, these service professionals have been screened as follows:<br /> <br /> Shoclef will only display Shoclef Service professionals that</p>
<ol>
<li>Have an Overall "A" or "B: rating from member reviews;</li>
<li>Have passed all background checks established by Shoclef (as described below);</li>
<li>Attest that they possess all applicable state and local licensing, registration, or other trade requirements to provide service for the Project or the project described in the Lead; and</li>
<li>Are in good business standing with Shoclef</li>
</ol>
<p>Shoclef has criminal background checks performed annually on the principal/owner or relevant manager of all "A"- and "B"-rated companies that are Certified Service Providers, that offer ecommerce offers, that receive leads through the Projects Submissions platform, or that are granted the Super Service Award. The background check currently is performed by American Business Services ("ABS"), a third-party screening company. Upon processing the background check, ABS will provide Shoclef with a simple "pass" or "fail" designation. A failed background check is one that finds one or more of the following: (1) any violent or theft conviction at a felony level in the last 7 years; (2) any sexual felony conviction or on a sexual offender registry at any time (no time limit); or (3) any pending felony charges involving any of types (1) or (2).</p>
<p>ABS will provide Shoclef with only a pass or fail designation. Shoclef and its members will never see any content from background check results. Since we can only perform these background checks annually, we ask anyone with knowledge of legal, ethical or financial concerns regarding a company contact us by either logging in and selecting Send A Message using our contact form. Shoclef will investigate any information we receive regarding a company's background.</p>
<p>While we always strive to provide the most current information, we also recommend that you perform your own research on the companies you hire.</p>

<li><strong>FIXED PRICE SERVICES&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<ol>
<li>Shoclef (through its affiliate, Handy, Inc.), provides certain services labeled "Fixed Price Services." Through Fixed-Price Services, you will pay for your home service upfront and book the time and date of your service through our secure online portal. Shoclef, THROUGH THE Shoclef PLATFORM, OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO OBTAIN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND/OR MERCHANDISE, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE SUCH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR MERCHANDISE ITSELF OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A RETAILER OR MANUFACTURER, OR AS A CLEANING, HANDYMAN, OR OTHER HOME-RELATED OR MOVING-RELATED SERVICE PROVIDER, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND/OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED TO THE REQUESTER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE. SHOCLEF IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH, ENDORSED OR SPONSORED BY ANY THIRD PARTY MERCHANDISE PROVIDER OR RETAILER.&nbsp;</li>
<li>SCREENING FOR FIXED PRICED SERVICES (NOTE: SCREENING FOR STANDARD SERVICES CAN BE FOUND IN SECTION 10).<br /> For Fixed Price Services, we use a multi-step process to screen potential cleaning and handyman service professionals. The process is designed to filter qualified potential cleaning and handyman service professionals with appropriate backgrounds in compliance with applicable law. The potential cleaning and handyman service professional must provide detailed personal information. These service professionals must provide their full name, address, date of birth, social security number, and a valid form of identification and validate their applicable home services experience. We verify these potential service professional's identities. For Fixed Price Services, we utilize Jumio, an identification verification company, to match the photographs and confirm the integrity of the identification documents. These service professionals then submit to a background check. For Fixed Price Services, we currently use a third-party background check provider, Checkr, Inc., to conduct the background checks.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Checkr's Background Check Process</p>
<p>Checkr, a third-party background check provider accredited by the National Association of Professional Background Screeners, conducts a record search which looks back at least seven years or longer in other jurisdictions when permitted by applicable law and available records. Checkr specifically conducts the following checks and searches:</p>
<p>IDENTITY VERIFICATION Social Security Number (SSN) verification is the most efficient way to verify these potential service professional's identities. If an identity cannot be verified, the Checkr system alerts these potential service professionals to request additional documentation.</p>
<p>ADDRESS HISTORY Checkr's Identity Check includes a trace of all known domestic addresses over the past seven years. Based on this information, Checkr searches relevant court jurisdictions for the same time period.</p>
<p>Criminal Records Check</p>
<p>COUNTY CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK Checkr performs direct searches of county court records. Results include felony and misdemeanor criminal cases as well as, charges, disposition, dates and sentencing information.</p>
<p>NATIONAL CRIMINAL RECORDS CHECK This check scours over 30 million records and is run concurrent with the county criminal records check.</p>
<p>GLOBAL WATCHLIST CHECK This check searches known domestic and international terrorist watchlists as well as the records of the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Excluded Parties List (EPL) and additional domestic and international agency lists.</p>
<p>SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY CHECK Checkr searches registries for every state. In certain states, the information publicly available does not include all registered sex offenders and may not include all out-of-state sex offenders, depending on variations in state law.</p>
<p>Review &amp; Activation</p>
<p>For Fixed Price Services, we review the background checks in compliance with applicable law before determining whether such applicant should be activated to use the platform.</p>

<li>Fixed Price Services Recommendations Explanation.&nbsp;All recommended Fixed Price Professionals have received a "star" rating of at least four stars. These Fixed Price Professionals are recommended by other consumers, not by Shoclef.</li>
<li>Fixed Price Payments&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>Users of the Shoclef Platform for Fixed Price Services purchased and paid for on the Shoclef website, contract for Professional Services directly with other Users. Shoclef is not a party to any contracts for Professional Services. The Shoclef Platform facilitates these contracts by supplying a medium through which individuals seeking to obtain services ("Requesters") can connect with individuals seeking to provide services ("Professionals"), schedule certain services requested by the Requesters, which are to be completed by the Professionals, are hereinafter referred to as "Professional Services", and make payments for Professional Services ("Payments"). Requesters are obligated to pay in advance for the Professional Services they order through the Shoclef Platform. Prior to the scheduled Professional Service, we will charge the Requester's credit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Shoclef Platform with respect to all Professional Services, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees or expenses associated with a Professional Service as well as the Trust and Support Fee (as defined in Section 12.e. below), and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit card on file in the Requester's Shoclef Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving Shoclef (or a third-party payment processor on Shoclef's behalf) permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you owe Shoclef. Depending on the transaction you selected or services requested, Shoclef may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Professional Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with Shoclef at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester's credit card for an ordered or completed Professional Service transaction. Seventy-two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. If the Requester has agreed with the Professional to extend or reduce the hours in or to reschedule a requested Professional Service, the Requester bears the responsibility for notifying Shoclef. Requesters must notify Shoclef by changing the date or hours of the requested Professional Service through the Shoclef Platform. All Payments by Requesters must be made through the Shoclef Platform. Any Payments paid or Professional Services scheduled outside of the Shoclef Platform are not subject to our Shoclef Happiness Guarantee in Section 12.d. below. Except for the Shoclef Happiness Guarantee in Section 12.d., no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester's credit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Shoclef's income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Shoclef or third parties, then Shoclef may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Shoclef or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (a) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (b) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (c) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (d) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.</li>
<li>Job Rate.&nbsp;The rate per hour for a Professional Service ("Job Rate") depends on factors, such as location and how frequently a Recurrent Service is ordered, and payment terms may increase. Therefore, the same Professional Service may cost more in a different location or if the Professional Service is ordered less frequently. However, you will be notified prior to any such payment increase with sufficient notice to enable you to cancel the Recurrent Service as set forth herein.</li>
<li>Recurrent Service.&nbsp;When requesting a Professional Service, Requesters may have the option of choosing that the Professional Service be repeated on a regular basis ("Recurrent Service"). For example, a Requester may choose that a cleaning be performed every two weeks. When a Requester chooses a Recurrent Service, the Shoclef platform will automatically schedule that Recurrent Service to occur on future dates indefinitely at the frequency requested by Requester. Requester's credit card will be charged the same non-promotional amount, as originally disclosed to Requester at the time of signing up for Recurrent Service for the Recurrent Service as the Professional Service appointments occur and for any applicable cancellation fees. Shoclef cannot guarantee that the same Professional will be available for each Recurrent Service appointment or that Recurrent Service appointments will not be canceled. Requesters may cancel the Recurrent Service at any time by visiting the Shoclef Contact Center at https://www.Shoclef.com/contact/https://www.Shoclef.com/contact/ or by mailing a notice of cancellation to Shoclef, Inc. Attn.: Legal, PO Box #1122, New York, NY 10159. Requesters must cancel more than twenty-four hours prior to the Professional Service in order to avoid being charged any cancellation fees and/or for the next Professional Service. After signing up for a Recurrent Service, you will be provided an email acknowledgment which includes information on how to cancel.</li>
