<p>Our services may allow you to &ldquo;tip&rdquo; other users to incentivize them to perform certain actions. For example, as a &ldquo;Buyer&rdquo;, you can tip a &ldquo;Shopper&rdquo; during your use of our services if the Player performs certain actions. We would like to remind you that you must comply with our Terms of Use, including our Terms of Services that describe how our services work. As stated in our Terms of Use, you must not ask other users to do anything illegal or would be harmful to them or others. You are also responsible for your own actions. As the transaction is strictly between you and the other user, we are not responsible for any claims or damages arising out of your offer of the tip or your acceptance of the tip. Please work with the other party to resolve any issues arising out of the transaction.</p>
